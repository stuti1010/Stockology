                  Insurance is a financial safety net that protects individuals and businesses from unexpected losses. It functions on the principle of risk-sharing, where a policyholder pays a premium to an insurance company in exchange for financial coverage against unforeseen events like accidents, health issues, property damage, or legal liabilities.
